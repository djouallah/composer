# USA Baby Names
This data comes form the Social Security Administration Names data.  The
data contains the number of births for each state, year and gender.

## What is this?

[Malloy Composer](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy-composer) is an open source tool for viewing and exploring data sets.  Data models are created in the  [Malloy](https://github.com/looker-open-source/malloy/) language.  Data can be served from a simple webserver or from a SQL database.  

See the [Malloy source code](https://github.com/lloydtabb/baby_names/) 




## Names by Generation

See each generation's most popular names and which states they are most popular in.  Scaning these results I noticed that in many of these names, Colorado is over represented.  Do you have any theories as to why these names are more popular in Colorado?
