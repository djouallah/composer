# USA Baby Names
This data comes form the Social Security Administration Names data.  The
data contains the number of births for each state, year and gender.

## What is this?

[Malloy Composer](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy-composer) is an open source tool for viewing and exploring data sets.  Data models are created in the  [Malloy](https://github.com/looker-open-source/malloy/) language.  Data can be served from a simple webserver or from a SQL database.  

See the [Malloy source code](https://github.com/lloydtabb/baby_names/) 


## Explore Names

Use the dashboard below to compare a bunch of names. Change the filter to select different names.

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Name Dashboard - Compare Names"
  model="names.malloy"
  renderer="dashboard"
-->
```malloy
query: names2 -> name_dashboard
```

## Names by Generation

See each generation's most popular names and which states they are most popular in.  Scaning these results I noticed that in many of these names, Colorado is over represented.  Do you have any theories as to why these names are more popular in Colorado?

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Current: Most popular female names on or after 2010"
  model="names.malloy"
-->
```malloy
  query: names2 -> names_chart + {
    where: gender = 'F'
    where: year_born ? >= 2010
  }
```

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Current: Most popular male names on or after 2010"
  model="names.malloy"
-->
```malloy
  query: names2 -> names_chart + {
    where: gender = 'F'
    where: year_born ? >= 2010
  }
```

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Gen-Z: Most popular female names between 1995 and 2010"
  model="names.malloy"
-->
```malloy
  query: names2 -> names_chart + {
    where: gender = 'F'
    where: year_born ? >= 1995 & <= 2010
  }
```

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Gen-Z: Most popular male names  between 1995 and 2010"
  model="names.malloy"

```malloy
  query: names2 -> names_chart + {
    where: gender = 'F'
    where: year_born ? >= 1995 & <= 2010
  }
```

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Millenial: Most popular female names between 1980 and 1995"
  model="names.malloy"
-->
```malloy
  query: names2 -> names_chart + {
    where: gender = 'F'
    where: year_born ? >= 1980 & <= 1996
  }
```

<!-- malloy-query  
  name="Millenial: Most popular male names  between 1980 and 1995"
  model="names.malloy"
-->
```malloy
  query: names2 -> names_chart + {
    where: gender = 'F'
       where: year_born ? >= 1980 & <= 1996
  }
```

## Iconic Names

For each state, which names are the most Iconic (unusally popular)?
 
 <!-- malloy-query  
  name="Iconic Names by State"
  model="names.malloy"
-->
```malloy
query: names2 -> iconic_names_by_state
```


## Names and Gender
Some names are gender neutral or gender specific by time or region.  

 <!-- malloy-query  
  name="Gender Neutral Name"
  description="Some names can be are common for both female and male genders.  This query investigates gender neutral names and their use over time and location."
  model="names.malloy"

  name="Kelly in Space and Time`"
  description="Examine the name 'Kelly' over time and location (in fine detail)."
  model="names.malloy"
  renderer="dashboard"

```malloy

```

 <!-- malloy-query
